# Turno Test Orientations

[This is the test](https://github.com/TidyDaily/developer-test)

Please make sure you use Laravel, React or vue.js (better if in vue.js) in the development.

Also use typescript (if possible) , this will help us to understand your level.

Normally our tests are deployed in heroku to make it easier for us to validate, feel free to use your own environment, just make sure we can access it.

The deliverable is a github repo and a URL to a deployed application.

It would helpful to take a look at the visual description found [here](https://github.com/TidyDaily/developer-test/blob/main/Code%20Challenge%20-%20Bank%20System%20Wireframes.pdf) , these are mobile screens but youo don't need to do mobile, can be web application.

## What do we look at when checking out the solution

**Functionality**: We’ll look at the application and verify if everything’s working properly.

**Performance**: We’ll analyze your code to see how performing it is, and how well it behaves with the requests being made.

**Code quality and organization**: We’ll check your knowledge to see if your code does what it’s meant to be done, if it’s easy to understand, if it’s testable and follows a consistent baseline throughout the app, as well as it’s properly organized.

**Framework knowledge**: We’ll verify your knowledge regarding the chosen framework; If you know how to use its tools properly, if you understand what those tools are meant to do, and how well you applied them, as well as following the framework’s rules and patterns;

### For the back-end specific requirements

- Automated Tests / Test Coverage
- API Access Control (Policies, Gates, etc.)
- And big extra points if you:
- Implement a design pattern (DDD, Repository Pattern, etc.)
- Make a good and cohesive database design

### For the front-end specific requirements

- TypeScript
- Code structure and organization (How you organize it is a personal choice, but it needs to be well organized and structured, as well as following your choice’s framework patterns and guidelines)

**And big extra points if you have a solid knowledge of:**

- Front-end cache
- Performance and monitoring tools

Please let me know if this is clear.
And if you can please let me know when do you think you can deliver the test.
Thanks
